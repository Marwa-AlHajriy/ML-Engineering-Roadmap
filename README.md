## Stage 2: Model Deployment + REST APIs

When deploying machine learning models, it's important to understand the environment where the model will run. Common deployment environments:

**On-Premises Deployment**
- **Definition**: Model is deployed on the organization's own physical servers.
- **Use Case**: Organizations with strict data security requirements (e.g., banks, hospitals).
- **Pros**: Full control over data, no third-party dependency.
- **Cons**: Expensive infrastructure, limited scalability, high maintenance.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- **Definition**: Cloud-based virtual machines where you manage the OS and environment (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine).
- **Use Case**: Teams wanting more control without owning physical servers.
- **Pros**: Scalable, flexible, full environment control.
- **Cons**: Still responsible for updates, monitoring, and configurations.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- **Definition**: Managed platforms where you only provide your code or model (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).
- **Use Case**: Fast deployment with minimal infrastructure concerns.
- **Pros**: Easy to use, auto-scaling, minimal setup.
- **Cons**: Less customizable, higher cost for large-scale apps.

## Stage 3: Create end-to-end ML project on cloud (AWS)

- Tutorial guide: End To End Machine Learning Project Implementation Using AWS Sagemaker by Krish Naik (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le-A72NjaWs)
- We will work on a different model, a classification CNN model using Brain Tumor MRI Dataset form Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset?resource=download)
